    <h1>Our goal</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our ultimate goal is to empower, develop and strenghten the skills and
      abilities of individuals and communities to effectively address
      challenges, make informed decisions and achieve their set goals and
      objectives and this can be achieved through capacity building, training
      and mentoring.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To be the Oasis for the lost hope upon which their seeds of survival and
      greatness will grow and flourish by creating a world where every
      individual and community has access to basic necessities of life,
      opportunities, resources and support needed to reach their full potential
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To continuously reduce the garment of unactualized dreams buried in our
      cemetery by empowering and mentoring individuals and communities through
      capacity building initiatives, fostering self-resilience, self-reliance
      and sustainable growth,

        <h1>Example project</h1>
         <br />
        <p> We offer useful workshops that help the community. For example, 
    we teach how to make your own soap. Soap is a powerful tool for 
    good hygiene and can help prevent illnesses. By normalizing the 
    possesion and use of soap, we strive to create a healthy community.
